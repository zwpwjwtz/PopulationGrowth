Simulation of Population Growth
==============

This is a C++ programme used for simulating population growth, based on the concept that families play an important role in society.

It is originally written in Visual Basic. However, considering the efficiency and portability, I rewrite it in C++.

The whole programme is licensed under GPL v3. You can make any use of it without prior coordination or asking for permission.
